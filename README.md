## Hi there üëã

Welcome to my corner of the internet.

I'm **Aasane Kariuki** ‚Äî builder, systems-thinker, and founder in the making.  
Rooted in Nairobi. Wired for impact. Unapologetically ambitious and Vibefull.

üß† **Developer | Economist | Entrepreneur | Eternal Student | AI lover | Quantum geek | STEM love**  
‚ö° Currently leading **NairobiKonnekt** ‚Äî a tech movement reimagining how everyday people move, trade, and thrive in Kenya‚Äôs urban jungle.  
üåç I believe code is poetry, systems shape society, and the future belongs to those bold enough to build it.

### üî• What I'm About

- üöÄ **Tech for transformation**  
  Not just building apps, but building answers. I create tools for real people solving real problems.

- üß© **Systems Thinking**  
  I don‚Äôt chase trends. I architect ecosystems ‚Äî connecting the dots where others see chaos.

- üß† **Neurogrowth & Discipline**  
  Mindset is the mainframe: daily rituals, deep learning, monk-mode habits ‚Äî all in pursuit of sharp thinking and sharper execution.

- üß± **Startup Mode**  
  MVPs over fluff. Progress over perfection. Building in public, bootstrapped with soul.

### üéØ My Philosophy

> Build like time is running out. Think like a philosopher. Move like a warrior.

- Speak with **intention** ‚Äî words are spells.
- Build with **conviction** ‚Äî half-steps don‚Äôt change the world.
- Connect with **authenticity** ‚Äî the real ones recognize real energy.

I‚Äôm not here for likes. I‚Äôm here to create. To collaborate. To leave proof.
