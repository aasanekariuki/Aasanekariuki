## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my corner of the internet.

I'm **Aasane Kariuki** — builder, systems-thinker, and founder in the making.  
Rooted in Nairobi. Wired for impact. Unapologetically ambitious and Vibefull.

🧠 **Developer | Economist | Entrepreneur | Eternal Student | AI lover | Quantum geek | STEM love**  
⚡ Currently leading **NairobiKonnekt** — a tech movement reimagining how everyday people move, trade, and thrive in Kenya’s urban jungle.  
🌍 I believe code is poetry, systems shape society, and the future belongs to those bold enough to build it.

### 🔥 What I'm About

- 🚀 **Tech for transformation**  
  Not just building apps, but building answers. I create tools for real people solving real problems.

- 🧩 **Systems Thinking**  
  I don’t chase trends. I architect ecosystems — connecting the dots where others see chaos.

- 🧠 **Neurogrowth & Discipline**  
  Mindset is the mainframe: daily rituals, deep learning, monk-mode habits — all in pursuit of sharp thinking and sharper execution.

- 🧱 **Startup Mode**  
  MVPs over fluff. Progress over perfection. Building in public, bootstrapped with soul.

### 🧪 Current Projects

- 🛠 **NairobiKonnekt**

- 📚 **Open Source & AI Experiments**  
  *Exploring AI-native workflows, GPT-powered dev tools, and how Africa can leapfrog with tech built for us, by us.*

- 🧠 **Builder’s Season Protocol**  
  *A daily operating system for mental clarity, physical edge, and relentless creation (June–Aug 2025). Discipline is the new luxury.*

### 🎯 My Philosophy

> Build like time is running out. Think like a philosopher. Move like a warrior.

- Speak with **intention** — words are spells.
- Build with **conviction** — half-steps don’t change the world.
- Connect with **authenticity** — the real ones recognize real energy.

I’m not here for likes. I’m here to create. To collaborate. To leave proof.

Stay dangerous. Stay building. The future favors the audacious.
