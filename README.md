## Hi there üëã

Welcome to my corner of the internet.

I'm **Aasane Kariuki** ‚Äî builder, systems-thinker, and founder in the making.  
Rooted in Nairobi. Wired for impact. Unapologetically ambitious and Vibefull.

üß† **Developer | Economist | Entrepreneur | Eternal Student | AI lover | Quantum geek | STEM love**  
‚ö° Currently leading **NairobiKonnekt** ‚Äî a tech movement reimagining how everyday people move, trade, and thrive in Kenya‚Äôs urban jungle.  
üåç I believe code is poetry, systems shape society, and the future belongs to those bold enough to build it.

### üî• What I'm About

- üöÄ **Tech for transformation**  
  So I'm not just building Apps, but building answers. I create tools for real people solving real problems.

- üß© **Systems Thinking**  
  I actually love building systems. I architect ecosystems, connecting the dots where others see chaos.

- üß† **Neurogrowth & Discipline**  
  Mindset is the mainframe: daily rituals, deep learning, monk-mode habits, all in pursuit of sharp thinking and sharper execution.
  
- ü§ù **I'm Interested in**
   **mentorship, brotherhood, and sharp minds**, not just to level up technically, but to grow as a founder, systems builder, and in motion.
  
- üí¨ **Ask me about**
   music, space, time, mythology, History, Philosophy ‚Äî I think about those things more than I probably should.

- ‚ö° **Fun Fact** I think the internet is the wildest social experiment of our time, and we‚Äôre all just trying to find meaning in the scroll.
